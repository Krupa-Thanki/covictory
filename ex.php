                </h3>
                <h4 class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-3"> Lunges are a popular strength training exercise among people wanting 
to strengthen, sculpt, and tone their bodies, while also improving 
overall fitness and enhancing athletic performance.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>This 
resistance exercise is popular for its ability to strengthen your back, 
hips, and legs, while improving mobility and stability. Lunges are ideal
 for those wishing to get stronger and for current athletes, including 
runners and cyclists.<br>
                  <br>Continue reading to take a look at the benefits of lunges along with what muscles they target and a few variation options.<br>

                  <br>
                  <br>Lunges
 work the large muscle groups in your lower body, which builds leans 
muscle and reduces body fat. This can increase your resting metabolism, 
which allows you to burn more calories and trim excess weight. If you’re looking to lose weight, push yourself to your outer limits by including lunges in a high-intensity circuit training routine using heavy weights.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.875rem;">2. Balance and stability</span>
                  <br>
                  <br>Lunges are a lower body unilateral exercise
 since you work on each side of your body independently. The single-leg 
movements activate your stabilizing muscles to develop balance, 
coordination, and stability. Working one leg at a time causes your body to be less stable, which forces your spine and core to work harder to stay balanced.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.875rem;">3. Alignment and symmetry&nbsp;</span>
                  <br>
                  <br>Lunges
 are better than bilateral exercises for rehabilitation since they can 
correct imbalances and misalignments in your body to make it more 
symmetrical.If you have one side that’s less strong or flexible, 
spend a bit of extra time working on this side so you don’t 
overcompensate or overuse the dominant side.<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.875rem;">4. Stand taller</span>
                  <br>
                  <br>Lunges
 strengthen your back and core muscles without putting too much stress 
or strain on your spine. A strong, stable core reduces your chance of 
injury and improves your posture, making common movements easier.&nbsp;<br>

                </h3>
                <h4 class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-6"> Perhaps one of the easiest exercise movements, the standard push up 
activates nearly every muscle in your body, which yields far more than 
toned muscles and increased endurance. If you’re not convinced about 
adopting a push up routine into your exercise program, or you simply 
wish to understand the power of this simple exercise, continue reading 
to uncover the real benefits of doing push ups.<br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.875rem;">
                    <br>1. Increase Functional Strength via Full Body Activation
                  </span>
                  <br>
                  <br>As you lower your body to the floor and the familiar “burn” begins to 
encompass your muscles the last thing you’re thinking about is the 
number of muscles you’re using. However, this is one of the top benefits
 of pushups. As you engage in this exercise, literally every major 
muscle in your body is called upon to execute the movement.<br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.875rem;">
                    <br>2.&nbsp;Muscle Stretching for Health and Vitality
                  </span>
                  <br>
                  <br>One of the most underrated benefits of doing push ups is the stretch it 
provides to your biceps and back muscles. As you lower yourself to the 
floor, your back muscles are effectively stretched, and as you push 
yourself to the starting position your biceps obtain a full stretch. 
This not only improves your flexibility, which helps prevent injuries, 
but a well-stretched muscle feature a solid and attractive appearance.<br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.875rem;">
                    <br>3.&nbsp;Enhance Your Cardiovascular System
                  </span>
                  <br>
                  <br>As stated earlier, push ups are classified as a compound exercise as it 
calls upon multiple muscle groups. When you simultaneously engage large 
muscle groups, your heart must work harder to deliver oxygen-rich blood 
to muscle tissue. Ultimately, this activity results in an effective 
cardiovascular exercise, which supports heart health and promotes the 
reduction of stored body fat.<br>

                <h4 class="u-text u-text-9"> The list of squat benefits is lengthy, but to summarize and point out 
the top picks, here are seven key benefits of doing squats.<br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.875rem;">
                    <br>1.&nbsp;Strengthens your core
                  </span>
                  <br>
                  <br>Having strong core muscles can make everyday movements like turning, 
bending, and even standing easier. Not only that, but a strong core can 
improve your balance, ease pain in your low back, and also make it 
easier to maintain good posture.&nbsp;<br>
                  <span style="font-size: 1.875rem; font-weight: 700;">
                    <br>2.&nbsp;Reduces the risk of injury
                  </span>
                  <br>
                  <br>When you strengthen the muscles in your lower body, you’re better 
able to execute full-body movements with correct form, balance, 
mobility, and posture. Plus, incorporating squats in your overall
 workout routine also helps strengthen your tendons, ligaments, and 
bones, which, according to the American Council on Exercise, may help reduce your risk of injury.&nbsp;<br>
                  <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.875rem;">
                    <br>3.&nbsp;Variety helps with motivation
                  </span>
                  <br>
                  <br>Once you master the basic squat, there are many different types of squat variations you can try. Changing up your squats can help keep the exercise interesting, while also activating different muscle groups. Squats
 can be done with just your body weight. They can also be done with 
weights, like dumbbells, barbells, kettlebells, or medicine balls, or 
with resistance bands or yoga balls.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br><b>What benefits can you get from squat variations?</b>
                  <br>
                  <br>Changing
 up the basic squat allows you to target different muscle groups. It 
also helps with motivation so you don’t get bored with performing the 
same move repeatedly. Before moving on to squat variations, make 
sure you have mastered the basic squat movement. These exercises are 
more challenging and require more strength, flexibility, and core 
activation.&nbsp;<br>

                <h4 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-15"> KapalabhatiKapalabhati pranayama literally means “skull shining 
breath”. It is more active and fire inducing than dirgha or ujjayi, and 
you may feel like you have more energy afterwards.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Kapalabhati is great for toning the abdomen and clearing out the 
sinuses. It also stimulates the chakras of the face and third eye.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Begin in a seated position. Take a few clearing breaths to center 
yourself. Place one hand on your solar plexus over the upper abdomen. 
Deeply inhale through the nostrils and expand the belly into your hand.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Exhale sharply through the nose and squeeze the belly button in 
towards the spine. Allow the lungs to fill up naturally and quickly on 
the inhale, then exhale sharply again. Repeat these quick inhales and 
forceful exhales at a steady pace 20 times.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Make sure that you are taking in enough air on the inhale and 
squeezing out all the air on the exhale. If you feel light-headed, slow 
down and return to a normal breath for several minutes.<br> Otherwise, continue with kapalabhati pranayama for two more rounds.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>This is an excellent breath to perform before a more rigorous yoga practice.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>It is best to start with 1 minute of kapalabhati. Once you feel 
comfortable with that, you can slowly increase 1 minute at a time.

                <h4 class="u-text u-text-18"> Alternate nostril kapalabhati works similarly to kapalabhati, but you only exhale on one side at a time.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Any alternate nostril breathing creates a balance and connection 
between the right and left sides of the brain. By performing this 
pranayama quickly, alternate nostril kapalabhati cleanses the nasal 
passages and clears the lungs.<br>
                  <br>Begin in a comfortable seated posture on your mat. Take several deep 
breaths, such as dhirga or ujjayi to center the mind and body.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>With your right hand, bring your fingers to vishnu mudra by curling 
the middle and index fingers towards the palm. Hold your hand up to your
 face and inhale deeply through both nostrils.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Close your right nostril with your thumb and exhale sharply through 
the left side, making sure to contract your abdomen at the same time. 
Release the thumb and passively and quickly inhale through both sides.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Close your left nostril with your ring finger and exhale sharply 
through the right side. Repeat these sharp exhales through one nostril 
and passive inhales through both 20 times. This amount will equate to 
roughly 1 minute of breathwork. Once you feel like you’ve mastered the 
minute, you can increase by 1 minute increments.

                  <br><b>&nbsp;How to do the Vajrasana pose</b>
                  <br>
                  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Start by kneeling on the floor. Consider using a yoga mat for comfort.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Pull
 your knees and ankles together and point your feet in line with your 
legs. The bottoms of&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;your feet should face upward with your big toes 
touching.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Exhale as you sit back on your legs. Your buttocks will rest on your heels and your thighs will&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;rest on your calves.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Put your hands on your thighs and adjust your pelvis slightly backward and forward until&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;you’re comfortable.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Breathe
 in and out slowly as you position yourself to sit up straight by 
straightening your&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;spine. Use your head to pull your body upward and 
press your tailbone toward the floor.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Straighten your head to 
gaze forward with your chin parallel to the floor. Position your hands&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; palms down on your thighs with your arms relaxed.<br>
