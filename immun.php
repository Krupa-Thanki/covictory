 some people, vitamin C might cause side effects such as stomach cramps,
 nausea, heartburn, and headache. The chance of getting these side 
effects increases with higher doses. Taking more than 2000 mg daily is 
possibly unsafe and may cause kidney stones and severe diarrhea. In 
people who have had a kidney stone, taking amounts greater than 1000 mg 
daily increases the risk of getting more kidney stones.<br>

                  <br><b>Cancer</b>: Cancerous cells collect high

 vitamin C under the direction of your oncologist.<br>
                  <br><b>Chronic kidney disease</b>:
 Long-term kidney disease might increase the risk of vitamin C 
deficiency. Vitamin C supplements might also increase the amount of 
oxalate in the urine in some people. Too much oxalate in the urine can 
increase the risk of kidney failure in people with kidney disease. <br>
                  <br><b>A metabolic deficiency called "glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase" (G6PD) deficiency</b>:
 Large amounts of vitamin C can cause red blood cells to break in people
 with this condition. Avoid excessive amounts of vitamin C.<br>
                  <br><b>Kidney stones</b>:
 Large amounts of vitamin C can increase the chance of getting kidney 
stones. Do not take vitamin C in amounts greater than those found in 
basic multivitamins.<br>
                  <br><b>Smoking and chewing tobacco</b>: Smoking
 and chewing tobacco lowers vitamin C levels. People who smoke or chew 
tobacco should consume more vitamin C in the diet.

the RDA is 600 IU (15 mcg) daily. In children, the RDA depends on age. 
Vitamin D is also made in the skin after sun exposure. Spending 15-30 
minutes in the sun each day should be enough to maintain normal vitamin D
 levels for most people.<br>
                  <br> Most people should not consume more
